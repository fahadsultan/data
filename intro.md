I am originally from **[Lahore, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore)** (_Fun fact: Population of Lahore > 
Population of New York City_) and joined **Furman University** in Fall 2022 after earning my Ph.D. in Computer Science from **State University of New York at Stony Brook**.

Fresh out of college, I worked as a professional video game developer for a startup that later got acquired by the Japanese gaming giant DeNA. During this time, I was part of the team that built TapFish, the top-grossing game worldwide, for two weeks in 2011, on both the App Store and Google Play.

I then went on to work at Technology for People Initiative, an applied research lab in my where I mined social media and cell phone data for proxies of socio-economic indicators that allowed more inclusive policy-making for marginalized communities. During these years, I also dabbled in data journalism and helped organize a boot camp on using data for journalists with the support of the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and the Knight Foundation.

In 2015, I moved to Mecca, Saudi Arabia to work for the GIS Innovation Center (now Wadi Makkah). There I worked on innovative urban sensing techniques for better crowd control during the annual pilgrimage to the city, the largest human gathering in the world every year.

During my PhD, Fahad worked at the intersection of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and machine learning. My work focused on identifying neurological and genetic biomarkers linking type-2 diabetes with cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's and other dementias.

## What is _Data Mining_?

In the 1990‚Äôs "data mining" was an exciting and popular new concept. Around 2010, people instead started to speak of "big data". Today, the popular term is "data science". There are some who even regard data mining as synonymous with machine learning. There is no question that some data mining appropriately uses algorithms from machine learning. However, during all this time, the concept remained the same: use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems in science, commerce, healthcare, government, the humanities, and many other fields of human endeavor. 

In this course, I 

Statisticians were the first to use the term ‚Äúdata mining.‚Äù Originally, ‚Äúdata mining‚Äù or ‚Äúdata dredging‚Äù was a derogatory term referring to attempts to extract information that was not supported by the data. Section 1.2 illustrates the sort of errors one can make by trying to extract what really isn‚Äôt in the data.
Today, ‚Äúdata mining‚Äù has taken on a positive meaning. Now, statisticians view data mining as the construction of a statistical model, that is, an underlying distribution from which the visible data is drawn. 

Computer Science is the confluence of mathematics, algorithms, software (programming), and hardware.

In this course, with the exception of hardware, we will summon all of these to study data mining.

## Data Science Lifecycle

The data science lifecycle is a high-level overview of the data science workflow. It's a cycle of stages that a data scientist should explore as they conduct a thorough analysis of a data-driven problem. 

There are many variations of the key ideas present in the data science lifecycle. In Data 100, we visualize the stages of the lifecycle using a flow diagram. Notice how there are two entry points.

Data Science Lifecycle
``` 

### Ask a Question 

Whether by curiosity or necessity, data scientists will constantly ask questions. For example, in the business world, data scientists may be interested in predicting the profit generated by a certain investment. In the field of medicine, they may ask whether some patients are more likely than others to benefit from a treatment. 

Posing questions is one of the primary ways the data science lifecycle begins. It helps to fully define the question. Here are some things you should ask yourself before framing a question.

- What do we want to know? 
    - A question that is too ambiguous may lead to confusion.
- What problems are we trying to solve?
    - The goal of asking a question should be clear in order to justify your efforts to stakeholders.
- What are the hypotheses we want to test?
    - This gives a clear perspective from which to analyze final results.
- What are the metrics for our success?
    - This gives a clear point to know when to finish the project.

### Obtain Data 

The second entry point to the lifecycle is by obtaining data. A careful analysis of any problem requires the use of data. Data may be readily available to us, or we may have to embark on a process to collect it. When doing so, its crucial to ask the following:  

- What data do we have and what data do we need?
    - Define the units of the data (people, cities, points in time, etc.) and what features to measure.
- How will we sample more data?
    - Scrape the web, collect manually, etc.
- Is our data representative of the population we want to study?
    - If our data is not representative of our population of interest, then we can come to incorrect conclusions.
    
Key procedures: *data acquisition*, *data cleaning*

### Understand the Data

Raw data itself is not inherently useful. It's impossible to discern all the patterns and relationships between variables without carefully investigating them. Therefore, translating pure data to actionable insights is a key job of a data scientist. For example, we may choose to ask:

- How is our data organized and what does it contain?
    - Knowing what the data says about the world helps us better understand the world. 
- Do we have relevant data?
    - If the data we have collected is not useful to the question at hand, then we must collected more data.
- What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?
    - These can lead to many false conclusions if ignored, so data scientists must always be aware of these issues. 
- How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?
    - Data is not always easy to interpret at first glance, so a data scientist should reveal these hidden insights. 
    
Key procedures: *exploratory data analysis*, *data visualization*.

``` 

### Understand the World

After observing the patterns in our data, we can begin answering our question. This may require that we predict a quantity (machine learning), or measure the effect of some treatment (inference). 

From here, we may choose to report our results, or possibly conduct more analysis. We may not be satisfied by our findings, or our initial exploration may have brought up new questions that require a new data.

- What does the data say about the world?
    - Given our models, the data will lead us to certain conclusions about the real world.   
- Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?
    - If our model and data can not accomplish our goals, then we must reform our question, model, or both.  
- How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?
    - Inaccurate models can lead to untrue conclusions.

Key procedures: *model creation*, *prediction*, *inference*.

## Conclusion

The data science lifecycle is meant to be a set of general guidelines rather than a hard list of requirements. In our journey exploring the lifecycle, we'll cover both the underlying theory and technologies used in data science, and we hope you'll build an appreciation for the field.

With that, let's begin by introducing one of the most important tools in exploratory data analysis: `pandas`.
