    "# Uni-variate visualizations are used to understand each attribute in the dataset. In this section, we will look at techniques to understand the \"distribution\" of each attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Distribution of a variable is the frequency of each value of the variable. For example, if we have a variable \"age\", then the distribution of age is the frequency of each age value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We will discuss Distributions in much greater detail when we look at Probability and Statistics in a future chapter. For now, we will look at techniques that you can use to understand the distribution of your attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We will use the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to demonstrate the uni-variate visualizations. This is a binary classification problem where all of the attributes are numeric and have different scales. It is a great dataset for practicing on with neural networks because all of the inputs are small numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We will look at the following techniques in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Histograms.\n",
    "# - Density Plots.\n",
    "# - Box and Whisker Plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Histogram: Ordinal Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "# Histograms group data into bins and provide you a count of the number of observations in each bin. From the shape of the bins you can quickly get a feeling for whether an attribute is Gaussian, skewed or even has an exponential distribution. It can also help you see possible outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For a nominal or categorical variable, you can create a bar chart showing the count of each class value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Distributions often take on one of the following shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Bell\n",
    "# - Long tail\n",
    "# - Skewed\n",
    "# - Twin peaked\n",
    "# - Flat\n",

    "# ![Shapes](https://cdn-comlp.nitrocdn.com/jHZYXVQcGrlgKuxnSthsdCgKBQAsIMJC/assets/images/optimized/rev-bfec2c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Different-Type-of-Data-Distributions-1024x577.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The different shapes can help you to select the best plots and also suggest that some transforms of your data may be useful prior to modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The example below creates a histogram plot of the diabetes dataset input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Running the example creates a histogram plot for each numeric input variable in the dataset. We can see that some attributes may have an exponential distribution, such as attributes 3 and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can also see that other attributes may have a skewed distribution such as attributes 1, 5 and 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finally, perhaps we can see a few attributes that have a Gaussian distribution such as attributes 0, 4 and 8.\n",
