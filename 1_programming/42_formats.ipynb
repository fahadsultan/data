    "**Comma Separated Values (CSV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is a format used to store tabular data. It is a text file where each line is a row of data. Each row is separated by a comma. Each column is separated by a comma. The first row is the header row. The header row contains the names of the columns. The header row is separated from the data rows by a blank line.\n",

    "XLSX is a format used to store tabular data. It is a binary file where each line is a row of data. Each row is separated by a comma. Each column is separated by a comma. The first row is the header row. The header row contains the names of the columns. The header row is separated from the data rows by a blank line.\n",

    "XML is a format used to store hierarchical data. It is a text file where each line is a node of data. Each node is separated by a blank line. Each node has a name and a value. The name is separated from the value by a colon. The value is separated from the name by a colon. The first node is the root node. The root node contains the names of the nodes. The root node is separated from the data nodes by a blank line.\n",
