    "`matplotlib` is the primary plotting library in Python we are going to focus.  It is a very powerful library that can be used to create a wide variety of plots and graphs.  It is also very customizable.  However, despite its power, is can often be not very user-friendly.  It is very low-level and requires a lot of code to create even simple plots.  Fortunately, there are other libraries that are built on top of `matplotlib` that make it easier to create plots.  `seaborn` is a library that is built on top of `matplotlib`.  It is easier to use and creates more visually appealing plots.  On the other hand, it is also more specialized than `matplotlib` and can only be used to create certain types of plots.\n",
