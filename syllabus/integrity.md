# Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity standards are important to our Furman community and will be upheld in this class. Students should review the Academic Integrity Pledge and other resources available on the **[Academic Integrity](https://www.furman.edu/academics/academic-resources/academic-integrity/)** page on the Furman website. Pay special attention to definitions of cheating, plagiarism, unacceptable collaboration, facilitating misconduct and other types of misrepresentation. All those apply in this course.  

For programming assignments/homeworks and labs, follow the **[50 foot policy](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/50ft_policy.pdf)** in its spirit.

In this class, the grade penalty for an academic integrity violation is an F for the course. Academic Discipline procedures will be followed through the Office of the Academic Dean.
