    "## Common Data Formats \n",
    "\n",
    "Format is a term used to describe the way data is stored. For example, a single image is stored as a 2D array of pixels. A video is stored as a sequence of images. A sound is stored as a 1D array of samples. A text is stored as a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flat Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat data formats are native to `pandas` and are the simplest and the most ubiquitous file formats in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid data redundancy, data is often factored into multiple tables. For example, in a database of a school, there may be a table for students, a table for teachers, a table for classes, a table for grades, etc. Depending on the question of interest, these tables are then joined together to form a single table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comma Separated Values (CSV)\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is an open format used to store tabular data. It is a text file where **each line is a row of data**. In other words, **each line is separated by newline character `\\n`**. Within a row, **each column is separated by a comma `,`**. The first row is optionally the header row containing the names of the columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a CSV file is the [elections.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fahadsultan/datascience_ml/main/data/elections.csv) file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas you can **read a CSV** file as a pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first input to `pd.read_csv()` is the filename or filepath that you want to read. The other three most important parameters of the `pd.read_csv()` function are: \n",
    "1. `sep`: (default: `sep=','`) specifies the separator used to separate columns. Default is `,` which means the columns are separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `header`:  (default: `header=0`) specifies the row number to be used as the header. Default is `0` which means the first row is assumed to contain column names. If the file does not contain a header row, then `header=None` should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `names`: (default: `names=None`) specifies the column names as a list of strings. Default is `None` which means the column names are read from the header row.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `index_col`: (default: `index_col=None`) specifies the column number or column name to be used as the index. Default is `None` which means the index is automatically generated as integers starting from 0. If the file does not contain a header row, then `index_col=0` should be used.\n",
