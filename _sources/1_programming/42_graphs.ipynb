    "Graphs are a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (vertices) and a set of edges that relate the nodes to each other. The set of edges describes relationships among the vertices. Graphs are used to model many real-world systems, including computer networks, social networks, and transportation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are a very general structure, so they can be used to model many different kinds of systems. The nodes and edges can have any kind of data associated with them. For example, a graph could be used to represent a social network, where the nodes are people and the edges are friendships. The nodes could have additional data associated with them, such as the person's name, age, and hometown. The edges could have additional data associated with them, such as the date the friendship began."

    "There are two common ways to represent a graph as a matrix. The first way is to use an adjacency matrix, which is a matrix where each row and column represents a vertex. If there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, then the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ is 1. Otherwise, the entry is 0. For example, the following matrix represents a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges:\n",
