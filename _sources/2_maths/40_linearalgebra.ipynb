    "<!-- Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces. It is a fundamental tool in many fields, including data science and machine learning. In this section, we will review some of the basic concepts of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Vectors are often represented as arrows in a coordinate system. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are often used to represent physical quantities such as velocity, acceleration, and force. For example, the velocity of a car can be represented as a vector with a magnitude of 60 miles per hour and a direction of east.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can also be used to represent abstract quantities such as the number of people in a city. For example, the population of a city can be represented as a vector with a magnitude of 100,000 and a direction of north.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can be added together to form new vectors. For example, the velocity of a car can be added to the velocity of another car to form the velocity of a third car. Vectors can also be multiplied by scalars to form new vectors. For example, the velocity of a car can be multiplied by 2 to form the velocity of a car that is twice as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices are often used to represent linear transformations such as rotations and reflections. For example, a matrix can be used to represent a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise about the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices can be added together to form new matrices. For example, the matrix representing a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise about the origin can be added to the matrix representing a rotation of 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin to form the matrix representing a rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices can also be multiplied together to form new matrices. For example, the matrix representing a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise about the origin can be multiplied by the matrix representing a rotation of 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin to form the matrix representing a rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors to vectors. For example, a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise about the origin is a linear transformation that maps vectors to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear transformations can be represented as matrices. For example, a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise about the origin can be represented as the matrix\n",

    "## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "An eigenvector is a vector that does not change direction when a linear transformation is applied to it. For example, the vector (1, 0) is an eigenvector of the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "because it does not change direction when the matrix is applied to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An eigenvalue is a scalar that represents the amount by which an eigenvector is scaled when a linear transformation is applied to it. For example, the eigenvalue of the vector (1, 0) for the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
