    "Logarithms are a useful tool for simplifying expressions. They are especially useful when dealing with large numbers. For example, consider the following expression:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a very large number, but we can simplify it using logarithms. We know that $10^{10} = 10000000000$, so we can rewrite the expression as:\n",
