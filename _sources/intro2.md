I am originally from **[Lahore, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore)** (_Fun fact: Population of Lahore > 
Population of New York City_) and joined **Furman University** in Fall 2022 after earning my Ph.D. in Computer Science from **State University of New York at Stony Brook**.

Fresh out of college, I worked as a professional video game developer for a startup that later got acquired by the Japanese gaming giant DeNA. During this time, I was part of the team that built TapFish, the top-grossing game worldwide, for two weeks in 2011, on both the App Store and Google Play.

I then went on to work at Technology for People Initiative, an applied research lab in my where I mined social media and cell phone data for proxies of socio-economic indicators that allowed more inclusive policy-making for marginalized communities. During these years, I also dabbled in data journalism and helped organize a boot camp on using data for journalists with the support of the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and the Knight Foundation.

In 2015, Fahad moved to Mecca, Saudi Arabia to work for the GIS Innovation Center. There he worked on innovative urban sensing techniques for better crowd control during the annual pilgrimage to the city, the largest human gathering in the world every year.

During my PhD, Fahad worked at the intersection of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and machine learning. My work focused on identifying neurological and genetic biomarkers linking type-2 diabetes with cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's and other dementias.

## What is _Data Mining_?

In the 1990‚Äôs "data mining" was an exciting and popular new concept. Around 2010, people instead started to speak of "big data". Today, the popular term is "data science". However, during all this time, the concept remained the same: use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems in science, commerce, healthcare, government, the humanities, and many other fields of human endeavor.

Statisticians were the first to use the term ‚Äúdata mining.‚Äù Originally, ‚Äúdata mining‚Äù or ‚Äúdata dredging‚Äù was a derogatory term referring to attempts to extract information that was not supported by the data. Section 1.2 illustrates the sort of errors one can make by trying to extract what really isn‚Äôt in the data.
Today, ‚Äúdata mining‚Äù has taken on a positive meaning. Now, statisticians view data mining as the construction of a statistical model, that is, an underlying distribution from which the visible data is drawn. 

Computer Science is the confluence of mathematics, algorithms, software (programming), and hardware.

In this course, with the exception of hardware, we will summon all of these to study data mining. 


## Assignments 

Approach assignments purely as opportunities to:

* Learn

* Prepare for Career/Grad School

* Prepare for Exams

* Find the joy in the course material!

Expect near maximum flexibility from me

* Soft deadlines: Weekly

* Hard deadlines: Before next Exam

## Written Assignment

These would build on your understanding of algorithms covered in class

Would generally involve tracing algorithms and dry-runs. May involve math. 

Expect similar questions on the exams

Both handwritten or typed submissions are acceptable 

Submit soft copy on Moodle
